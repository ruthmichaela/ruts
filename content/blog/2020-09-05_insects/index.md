Some are friends, some are not, but all are truly beautiful. Nature never ceases to amaze me, with it's diversity of designs and patterns, logic and engineering. Each creature with it's own line in this single song we call uni-verse. This gallery is only a brief collection of all that we witnessed over the summer season. Many, I am sure, evaded our eyes altogether.
