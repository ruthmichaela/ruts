I spent the afternoon re-organizing our "greens" bed. Pulling the straw off, lifting grass and henbit out and sorting through what's what. Seeds shift in the wind and rain, moving out of the perfect line you hope to create. Or perhaps the earth worms and Armadillidiidae have some kind of game they play called, "rearrange the seeds, as to confuse the lady."

This season we're growing rainbow chard, buttercrunch lettuce, and bloomsdale spinach as our greens of choice. By the looks of what I thinned today, we'll have far more than a family of 2.5 (2 humans + 1 shelter puppy turned mama's boy, whose meals I make) can possibly eat. A surplus for friends and family. The greens are only a few inches tall, but I'm already salivating. They look so beautiful and delicious. Colorful and crisp. With everything reorganized I think we're in the ballpark of 30 or so plants. It felt so nice getting all the plants put into order and tucked back into their straw cover. We've also got a big long row of chamomile coming in, another first for us. I drink only two things: water and herbal tea. I am excited to add to my homegrown herbal tea selection and hopefully have extra to make gifts with.

It's always a bit tricky starting something new from direct sow. When small, the spinach looks pretty darn similar to a tiny plantain weed. There's really not a handbook (that I know of, anyway) for vegetable sprout identification, so I'm navigating it intuitively and hoping to get it right.

Cabbage starters also went in today, along with some direct sow bush beans directly behind them. It's still a bit cool yet for the tomato starters to go in, so I'm holding out a couple more weeks for those.

Despite some unexpected frosty evenings, drenching rains, and super high winds, the plants are doing beautifully. This is the earliest I've ever had things rolling in the garden and it's exciting. We're barely into the season and I've already learned a plethora of new things. Because we started totally raw this year, and on our own property, we've been able to take our time in setting things up exactly how we want. The raised beds are filled with a garden mix (top soil, cow manure, sawdust, and leaf compost) from a local landscape store and tilled into the existing soil. While I'm currently keen on no-till management, my options were limited for getting started with the given timeline. Moving forward we intend to go totally no-till, implementing cover crops in the off-season, and ally planting with rotation.

I spent the last two months participating in Cornell University's Small Farms online program, completing both the soil health and beekeeping courses. Both left me profoundly inspired and educated with so many new concepts (like cover cropping) to bring to our mono-family urban farm. This little space of the internet is my way of sharing our experience with others, so they too may find inspiration and health in their little piece of earth, wherever that may be.
