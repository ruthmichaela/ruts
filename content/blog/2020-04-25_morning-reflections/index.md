The thoughts swirl and then settle, like a snow globe shaken for a season and then set aside.

Soften the face, the eyes, the lips, and tongue. Like a drawing of curtains, the light pours in.

The tip of my index finger touches the tip of my thumb; gently, like in the way butterfly wings were attached to the thorax when the creator built the prototype.

The connection a closed circuit.

Awareness moves to the tip of the nose, to the pineal gland, to the crown of my head. Down my spine, to my seat, rising and settling in the space around my heart.

Like a red carpet set just for me - visions of light and bright blood vessels nourishing my body. All the organs are joyful and clapping.

I'm glad I came today.
