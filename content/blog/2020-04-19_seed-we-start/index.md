There is something untangibly magical about starting plants from seed. There is a rhythm to the process: curating the perfect soil blend, dipping a finger into the soil, dropping the seed, covering, watering, warming, lighting, watching, and adjusting; witnessing and experiencing. Meditation in motion, driven by my [bhavana], or intention.

What is the soil and how does it work? What am I seeing and feeling and smelling? Is it dead or full of life? How will it feed the seeds? What feeds it? The sun and the microbiology and the fungi and the worms and the earth decay and the air and water. I see now; I see.

Seeds are a gift; what do they need? Don't read the packet; feel. Dig deeper. Observe the shape and color and texture in your hands. What does the plant want? Find stillness and listen. Mother the seeds.

What am I? The catalyst that ignites the process; dropping seed to soil. But more. What ignites the spark that drives the seed out of stillness? The light in my finger tips. Am I glowing? Have I nurtured my glow so that everything I touch illuminates? Is that possible? Of course, because I have witnessed it.

I cannot be nourished on words alone; while appetizing, they do not sustain me.

Just like the seeds, there is an innate wisdom programmed into each of my cells. The experience of my great great grandmothers and grandfathers moving through the same rhythm like a hymn that sings me. I know how to do this; they knew how to do this.

I find great comfort here. I'm rooted and stable. Content. What I add to this knowing, through learning, is just play.
[bhavana]	I wrote this post and then came across this lovely excerpt on the the interpretation of the word bhavana:

*"I imagine that when Gotama, the Buddha, chose this word to talk about meditation, he had in mind the ubiquitous farms and fields of his native India. Unlike our words 'meditation' or 'contemplation,' Gotama’s term is musty, rich, and verdant. It smells of the earth. The commonness of his chosen term suggests naturalness, everydayness, ordinariness. The term also suggests hope: no matter how fallow it has become, or damaged it may be, a field can always be cultivated — endlessly enhanced, enriched, developed — to produce a favorable and nourishing harvest"*
