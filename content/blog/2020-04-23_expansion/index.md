Energy always moving. In me. Through me.

Inhale expand; exhale contract; I find stillness.

Turning the soil with my hands; sweet and smells like home. Earthy and rich and vibrating. My cells talking with the cells in the soil. A conversation I can only feel.

Tiny seed sticking to my finger tip. Clinging for this brief moment.

The light in me sparks the light in it.

Dropping to the soil, life commences. Covered and warm. Hopeful and trying.

I watch, like a child, a million times a day for those first two leaves to emerge upward.

I lose count.

I am a nurse bee living my dharma.
