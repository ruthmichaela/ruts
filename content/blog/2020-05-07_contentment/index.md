Earlier this week I was out in the garden late in the afternoon. The sun was dipping low, flashing between the pines. I was working in one of the tomato beds. Removing volunteer grasses brought in by the straw, and pulling various weeds and things. Gently tugging and dropping. With the lift of heavier items the soil broke open, revealing the ecosystem of business it supports. Worms of all sizes whipping back into their dark home, tiny spiders scurrying to and fro, roly poly bugs crossing over the openings. Lost in observation, in the feeling of cold soil in my warm hands, of being. Running my hands across the tomatoes I started from seed, now rooting into the garden bed. The sweet smell of summer sticking to my skin, teasing my nose into telling my mouth to start planning for sun-soaked tomatoes. I did not hear the far-off noises, I didn't hear my mind thinking about anything I needed to do. I just was. I just am.

I am enough. My life is enough. Everything I have is enough. This is contentment.

I think in our modern society it's somewhat frowned upon to be content. Everybody hustlin' as the daft saying goes.

Contentment is symptom of gratitude. Sometimes it takes once not having to be thankful for what you now have. Sometimes it's simply a matter of taking stock of all that's around you. Of the people you adore in your life, of lessons you're learning, of being warm, fed, and with opportunity at your doorstep. Of things that bring you joy.

Before we eat any meal we give gratitude for the food before us. We know the many facets of effort involved from seed to plate. Gardening instills a sense of gratitude for life that is hard to explain in any other way.
