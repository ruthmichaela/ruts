Little plant on it's own, doing it's best but struggling alone. 

I plant a friend, or two or three. Together they thrive alongside the arriving birds, worms, and bees. Everybody with their own line in this single song called Universe. 

Branches of fruit winding among the flowers and herbs; more friends arrive, wasps, moths, beetles, and tiny things of wildness. 

The garden is vibing, glowing, humming, and living. Alive. Life becomes life. The life in this becomes the life in me and the life in everything I brush against. Thriving on diversity.
