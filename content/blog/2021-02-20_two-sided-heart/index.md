how is it  
that the hawk's heart   
doesn't break  
when she listens   
to the screams  
of the squirrel   
clamped   
between her toes  
digging deeper, no hesitation  
how, unblinking,     
she carries   
out her intention   
as the squirrel  
begs,  
let me stay,   
let me stay,   
let me stay...  

how  
the hawk carries the limp   
body of the squirrel  
back to her nest to feed   
her young  
her heart guiding her back   
to their begging,  
hungry,  
little mouths.
