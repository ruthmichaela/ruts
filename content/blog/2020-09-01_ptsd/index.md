This blog began as an endevour to discuss gardening and all the joys and challenges that come with it. But what gardening truly offers us is the understanding of the interconnectivity of life and I believe this space I've crafted here on the internet is (naturally) expanding into that same rhythm. I cannot help but to feel like I have much more I need to share, and that this is the platform in which I need to do so. Without further adieu...

The first time my chinese medicine practitioner suggested I had post-traumatic stress disorder all of my sense and logic froze. How could I have PTSD? That was reserved for war-survivors and those subjected to insanely stressful and intense environments - far worst than I'd certainly ever experienced. But the truth is that PTSD has no biased for events and that even you weren't fighting a war overseas, your body's programmed response is the same, regardless of named event.

I'm not going to elaborate on the details of my accumulated ptsd, other than to say it involved half a decade of emotional and physical turmoil that concluded with a horse riding accident that involved surgery and nearly 4 months of physical therapy (followed by another half decade of on-going therapies and more).
