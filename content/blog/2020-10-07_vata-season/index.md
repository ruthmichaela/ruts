There is a fire in my neck, burning behind my heart and throat.

A clenching of flesh and restriction of movement. 

How could this happen. I try and try and try. To do all the things that promise all the outcomes. Daily rituals, and studies, and eating all the glorious seasonal offerings; but here I am. Fragile. 

All the heaviness burrows into these tiny shoulders. Near and far, the weight of the world migrates into the dry cracks and flourishes.

And I remember my own mind-made expectations that I haven't met today: 
Get to the mat, breath in and out and in and out, and sing from deep in your chest, into the heavens like you mean it.

I listen to the leaves crack as they let go of the branches they've known all their lives. 
I lose myself in the planting of fall harvest and the kneading of dough. 
I disappear into the woods and step softly, one foot following the other.
My breath syncing with the prana, without effort.

I am tossed between the autumn wind, as it whispers narratives to my soft mind, once again.
