  title: Walnut and Garlic Basil Pesto
  instructions: |
    **Ingredients**

    - 6 cups fresh basil leaves
    - 1/2 cup chopped walnuts
    - 3 medium or 2 large garlic cloves
    - 4T extra virgin olive oil (or more as needed)

    **Instructions**

     In a medium to large sized food processor add garlic and pulse until minced. Next add walnuts, basil leaves, and olive oil into the processor along with the garlic and run until basil leaves are chopped into to small (1cm or so) pieces. You may need to scrape the bowl and run the processor a little more. Add more olive oil as needed for desired texture. It should be creamy, not dry and crumbly. This recipe makes about 1 half-pint.

Hand sown, home grown, hand picked, hand washed, home-made pesto. That's hard to find in a store. A bounty of basil is a joy in the garden and in the kitchen. This pesto is very easy to make and can be frozen for quick and delicious meals in the depths of winter, when the basil plants are long gone. It is lovely on breakfast sandwiches as we discovered with our friends in Raleigh. We also made a big pot of pasta with sauteed veg, fresh parmesan and pesto - one of my favorite ways to enjoy it. 

To freeze, put into a freezer-safe container and drizzle more olive oil over the top to prevent freezer burn. Use within the next season or two for best taste.
