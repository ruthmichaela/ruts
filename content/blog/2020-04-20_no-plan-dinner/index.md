  title: Balsamic Roasted Brussel Sprouts and Kamut
  instructions: |
    **Ingredients**

    - 1 cup Kamut (Bob's Red Mill is a good, common resource)
    - 3 cups vegetable stock
    - 1 Bay leaf
    - 1/2 vidalia onion, sliced thin
    - 2T Sunflower Oil (or other high heat oil)
    - 2T chopped Oregano

    **For the Brussel Sprouts**

    - 1lb brussel sprouts, washed and quartered
    - 1/8 cup dried cherries
    - 1T sliced almonds
    - 2T balsamic vinegar
    - 2T Avocado oil (or sub your fave)
    - Salt and Pepper to taste

    **For the sauce**

    - 2 heaping spoonfuls of Tahini
    - 2T wild, local honey
    - 1/4 tsp cumin
    - 1/4 tsp cinnamon
    - small squirt Sriracha
    - 1 tsp stone ground mustard
    - 1 tsp Bragg's liquid aminos (can sub with low sodium soy sauce)

    **Step 1: Make the Kamut**

     Soak 1 cup of Kamut in water overnight, as directed. Or you can do like me and just not...
     Bring 3 cups of vegetable stock to a boil in a large sauce pan with lid. Add Kamut and bay leaf. Reduce heat to simmer. Cook for 1 hour if you forgot to soak; 30 min if you soaked it over night.

    **Step 2: Make the Brussel Sprouts**
 
     Preheat oven to 425 (the toaster oven works great for this)
     Add quartered brussel sprouts to a square glass pan
     Stir in avocado oil, balsamic, salt and pepper
     Bake for 20 minutes...(now go to sauce and onions)
     Stir in cherries and almonds
     Bake for another 15 minutes (depends on the size of your sprouts - big ones take longer.)
     When you can easily get a fork through, they're done. Turn off the oven and let sit to keep warm.

    **Step 3: Make the sauce**

     In a small mixing bowl add all the ingredients. Stir with a fork until smooth and mixed. Give it a taste and adjust to your palate.
     Coarsely chop the fresh Oregano and set aside.

    **Step 4: Fry the onions**

     Add sunflower oil to small sauce pan. Heat over medium (hot oil pops and hisses...be mindful).
     Once the oil is obviously hot (sizzling a bit), add the sliced onions in.
     Cook until lightly brown, then stir
     Monitor closely. As onions darken pull from pan and place on a plate lined with a paper towel.
     Once all onions are crispy and removed from the pan, sprinkle with a bit of salt.

    **Step 5: Plate and eat!**

    Plate in order: kamut, brussels, sauce (drizzled with spoon), oregano, onions
    Give gratitude and enjoy.

Cooking is one of my very favorite means of creativity. Perhaps this is why I enjoy gardening so much, the pre-req to a good meal. I think getting lost in something that brings you joy is one of the simplest and most true forms of meditation. I find that often in the kitchen.

Sometimes I have not a clue what to make for dinner, so I just let my intuition do the decision making. I am always curious about how to balance flavors and textures and from time to time I end up with something quite lovely and unique. This was one of those evenings.

This meal is deeply earthy with a sweet undertone balancing out the bitter of brussels and balsamic. It finishes with a satisfying chew provided by the Kamut.

I hope you enjoy this as much as we did.
