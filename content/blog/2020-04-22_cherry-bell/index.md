I love radishes. I love them as a snack, in salads, and roasted. This is our first year trying them out in the garden and I'm both impressed and delighted. My only complaint is that I didn't plant enough of them the first succession.

They are juicy, sharp and sweet, with the perfect little crunch. We sowed ours as soon as we noticed daffodils breaking through winter's grip. They were a little slow to start, but are now cruising. I may have put them in a touch too early, but the excitement could not be contained.

We have 6 brand new raised beds this year and I come equipped with more knowledge than any season prior. This is the fun part of gardening, right? Growing with each season. My intention for this year is to promote and improve soil health and to experiment with companion planting. I'm beyond the point of reading about it all and now into the realm of creativity and intuition. I'm experimenting with mixing herbs and annuals in the beds alongside vegetables. I want to create a balanced system that makes the vegetable plants practically feel like they're at a five-star luxury resort, just soaking up the sun and relishing in the beauty of existence. With blooms sprinkled throughout, I aim to encourage pollinators to come flying in, rewarding the plants with pollination like it's a pina colada bar. (It's COVID quarantine, and i'm still dreaming of our cancelled beach vacation)

Once you begin to notice the bright red radish popping up through the soil you know it will be ready for picking soon. Look for a good-sized diameter and healthy, strong greens.

As you can see in the photos, I'm using straw mulch. Just prior to getting it down (ya know, waiting on the wind to chill for a second) we had some radishes split. I suspect this was from the naked soil getting slightly dry, followed by a heavy drenching rain. The little radish swelled and burst. It still tasted amazing, but I needn't the delicate things cracking on me. With mulch on, I've not seen it occur again. I'm partial to straw mulch at the moment, and it's serving the soil well. It's holding moisture longer (duh, not evaporating) and the soil temps are staying more even despite a few suprise frost-advisory evenings. The soil also looks gorgeous after a few weeks cozied up in the mulch. I didn't line the soil first, so I am getting some grass growth. However, it's easy enough to grab hold of, pull, and drop back into the soil (it's also strangely fun and satisfying). Free organic matter, IMO. Last year I did burlap and liked it well enough. This year I just didn't even think about it. We'll see if I pay for it come late season.

Radish is a good balancer of Yin and Yang (warm and cool/light and dark) energies. With Spring comes Kapha ('that which flourishes in water', translated from Sanskrit) qualities of warmth, heavy, earthy, and transformational. Radish is perfect for us during this time, as we begin transitioning our bodies out of winter mode. If you're still feeling winter's chill in your bones, you can roast radishes in a bit of oil (I like avocado) with salt and pepper. This is one of my very favorite ways to enjoy them. If you're still feeling winter's cold chill, you may want to avoid cold and raw, as your body won't have the heat and energy to effeciently digest it just yet.

I would encourage anyone starting out to give radishes a go. They are so delicious (even little Issac tried to sneak away with a bite...) and give a good boost of encouragement when winter lingers on.
