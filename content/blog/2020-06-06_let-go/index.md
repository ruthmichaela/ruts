I let go of formal education because it made it hard to think.

I let go of social media because it made it hard to hear.

I let go of striving for the future because it made it hard to feel.

I hear the birds mastering their songs, and the tapping of tree leaves. I feel the edges of my feet connecting to the cold soil and soft grass beneath me. I feel the wind weaving between each strand of my untamed hair. My thoughts are simple and sweet; few and seldom. This is enough.
