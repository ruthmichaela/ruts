We used to walk way out in the field. 3am; our breath guiding the way forward.

Soft paws on crunchy earth; my awareness both above and below my horizon line.

The stars in order, as if expecting our return... night after night after night. 

The zip of my coat, like a curtain being draw, glowing like they'd rehearsed. 

Stable and holding space for us - these last moments together. 

Forever illuminating me.
