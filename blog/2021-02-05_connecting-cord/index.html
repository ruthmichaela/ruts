They each sip from rainwater puddles created during the overnight shower, dipping to sip, then lifting their head upward to gently coax it in the opposite direction. I imagine that below their tiny tapping feet is the quiet stirring of earthworms, noting the enthusiastic activity overhead - an early indicator of warming soil.</p><p>On top of our shipping container more birds are bathing in water gathered in the crevices of the roof top. Each bird splashing cold droplets into the air with every vibration of ruffling feathers; every droplet catching the light of the late morning sun.</p><p>Flying from pine to pine then from cherry tree to freshly filled bird feeder, they each sing a line from their avian hymnal. Soft and sweet. Full of grace.</p><p>In my foreground a gray squirrel walks across the deck, her coat thick, soft, and glossy - she&rsquo;s been eating well. She leans low to take a sip of water that&rsquo;s been filtered through the mint plant and into a tray of natural stones - placed for wildlife like her. She closes her eyes softly as she sips the water - I sense that the mint delights her senses in the same way it delights mine. Sweet and cool hit my palate, a subconscious, empathic response to the moment.</p><p>While witnessing this celebration between creatures, I consider how much of what they are engaging with we brought here with us. All man-made, placed into nature by our own hands. Unnatural. But by what I can see, causing a great deal of joy on this winter&rsquo;s morning. A connecting cord of gratitude and delight between nature and human. Imagine that.</p></div></div></article><div class="grid_12col grid__9col--desktop grid__3start--desktop mbxs mbmd--desktop"><a class=button href=/>&larr; Return</a></div></div></main></div></body></html>
