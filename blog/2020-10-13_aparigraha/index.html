Asana, what most of the west thinks of when they think &ldquo;yoga&rdquo; is just one of those branches. Yoga goes much, much further than the mat.</p><p>Yamas are moral guidelines to help us live peacefully and comfortably in the world around us.</p><p><strong>The five Yamas are:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Ahimsa:</strong> live without causing harm - this includes yourself, other people, nature, the planet, etc.</li><li><strong>Satya:</strong> speak and live in truth.</li><li><strong>Asteya:</strong> don&rsquo;t take more that what you actually need.</li><li><strong>Brahmacharya:</strong> use your energy correctly, for the well-being of your Self and others.</li><li><strong>Aparigraha:</strong> don&rsquo;t be greedy or attached to things.</li></ul><p>Gardening more than anything else in life has illuminated the essence of Aparigraha for me. Anyone new to gardening is immediately interested in the harvest. From planning the many summer dishes they&rsquo;ll try, to counting canning jars, all before the seeds have sprouted. I love enthusiasm and sometimes the delight of potential is a catalyst for enthusiasm. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that. The problem becomes that when gardening gets tough, as it always does, that delight is like a shooting star - blazes hot and disappears quick. That delight and enthusiasm suddenly fades and the intention to garden evaporates along with it.</p><p>With yoga (all eight-limbs!) we learn to sit with things. It gives us the opportunity to redefine what it means to exist, which at its essence is to simply be present and feel all the feels as they come. Some of my favorite moments in the garden are simple. When I think back on the season, I often remember these things - not the harvest or the meal, but what I felt&mldr;</p><ul><li>Sowing seeds; the temperature of the earth on my fingertips as I create space for the seed to come home to.</li><li>The scent of all the different plants as I walk between beds, seducing me closer. The electromagnetic field of my heart crossing into plant territory and mixing together for a divine experience that cannot be mimicked, explained, or reasoned about.</li><li>Observing the life that arrives when you bring life into a space on earth. Plant the things and the insects will come. Each of them adding to the energy of the plant, the soil, the ether around it all. Most days I&rsquo;d see the same insects again and again. They, just as much as the plants, became familiar faces.</li><li>The sheer delight in the sight of edibles. It&rsquo;s the tiny cucumbers, green tomatoes, squash blooms that excite me the most. By the time I pick anything to eat I&rsquo;m simply swollen with gratitude, humbled, and honored at what it means to be nourished by all of this that I set in motion.</li></ul><p>The best way to understand something, truly, is to live it. It is easy enough to write the rules on a notecard and stick it to your refrigerator, but it is not until you <em>feel</em> it that you no longer think about the meaning, you live it.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t think Patanjali was gardening when he wrote about Aparigraha (though I like to think he was), but perhaps he felt the same essence deep in his bones then that I do now. That once Aparigraha is simply felt, it is woven into the fabric of your Self and you are forever awed by each moment, no longer chasing the bumper crop.</p></div><div class="mbsm border-left--ltgreen order1 order2--desktop flex__grow--desktop flex__basis flex__grow--desktop"><img src=/blog/2020-10-13_aparigraha/aparigraha-0_hud79d2e95c31e3bfcded1c667e052a393_766523_800x0_resize_q75_box.JPG srcset="/blog/2020-10-13_aparigraha/aparigraha-0_hud79d2e95c31e3bfcded1c667e052a393_766523_600x0_resize_q75_box.JPG 600w, /blog/2020-10-13_aparigraha/aparigraha-0_hud79d2e95c31e3bfcded1c667e052a393_766523_1000x0_resize_q75_box.JPG 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 1024) 525px, calc(100vw - 60px)" alt=aparigraha-0.JPG class="max-width plxs plsm--desktop mbxs mbsm--desktop" loading=lazy>
