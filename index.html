They each sip from rainwater puddles created during the overnight shower, dipping to sip, then lifting their head upward to gently coax it in the opposite direction. I imagine that below their tiny tapping feet is the quiet stirring of earthworms, noting the enthusiastic activity overhead - an early indicator of warming soil.</p><p>On top of our shipping container more birds are bathing in water gathered in the crevices of the roof top. Each bird splashing cold droplets into the air with every vibration of ruffling feathers; every droplet catching the light of the late morning sun.</p><p>Flying from pine to pine then from cherry tree to freshly filled bird feeder, they each sing a line from their avian hymnal. Soft and sweet. Full of grace.</p><p>In my foreground a gray squirrel walks across the deck, her coat thick, soft, and glossy - she&rsquo;s been eating well. She leans low to take a sip of water that&rsquo;s been filtered through the mint plant and into a tray of natural stones - placed for wildlife like her. She closes her eyes softly as she sips the water - I sense that the mint delights her senses in the same way it delights mine. Sweet and cool hit my palate, a subconscious, empathic response to the moment.</p><p>While witnessing this celebration between creatures, I consider how much of what they are engaging with we brought here with us. All man-made, placed into nature by our own hands. Unnatural. But by what I can see, causing a great deal of joy on this winter&rsquo;s morning. A connecting cord of gratitude and delight between nature and human. Imagine that.</p></div></div></article><article class="pxs psm--desktop border--ltgreen grid__12col grid__9col--desktop grid__3start--desktop mbsm mbmd--desktop"><div class=tc><a class="hoverUnderline tc dib mbxs mla mra" href=/blog/2020-11-02_celestial-imprint/><time class=letterspace datetime=2020-11-02>2020-11-02</time></a></div><h1 class="tc upper letterspace">Loving Memory</h1><div class="mbsm mra mla border-bottom--pink border-width"></div><div class="markdown mbxs mbmd--desktop"><p>We used to walk way out in the field. 3am; our breath guiding the way forward.</p><p>Soft paws on crunchy earth; my awareness both above and below my horizon line.</p><p>The stars in order, as if expecting our return&mldr; night after night after night.</p><p>The zip of my coat, like a curtain being draw, glowing like they&rsquo;d rehearsed.</p><p>Stable and holding space for us - these last moments together.</p><p>Forever illuminating me.</p></div></article><article class="pxs psm--desktop border--ltgreen grid__12col grid__9col--desktop grid__3start--desktop mbsm mbmd--desktop"><div class=tc><a class="hoverUnderline tc dib mbxs mla mra" href=/blog/2020-10-16_coyote/><time class=letterspace datetime=2020-10-16>2020-10-16</time></a></div><h1 class="tc upper letterspace">Coyotes Call</h1><div class="mbsm mra mla border-bottom--pink border-width"></div><div class="markdown mbxs mbmd--desktop"><p>That first cold fall night</p><p>The coyotes call</p><p>And while no one else can hear it here; where maybe they are not, exactly</p><p>I have heard the clashing of cold and cries so many times that my</p><p>calibrated blood knows the season</p><p>by heart.</p></div></article><article class="grid__12col grid__9col--desktop grid__3start--desktop mbsm mbmd--desktop"><div class="grid__3start--desktop xs mbsm mbmd--desktop"><a class=hoverUnderline href=/blog/2020-10-13_aparigraha/><time class="dib mbxs letterspace" datetime=2020-10-13>2020-10-13</time></a><h1 class="upper letterspace">Aparigraha In The Garden</h1><div class="mra border-bottom--pink border-width"></div></div><div class="dg df--desktop"><div class="markdown mbxs prsm--desktop order2 order1--desktop flex__basis flex__grow--desktop"><p>Yamas are just one limb of Patanjali&rsquo;s eight-limbs of yoga. Asana, what most of the west thinks of when they think &ldquo;yoga&rdquo; is just one of those branches. Yoga goes much, much further than the mat.</p><p>Yamas are moral guidelines to help us live peacefully and comfortably in the world around us.</p><p><strong>The five Yamas are:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Ahimsa:</strong> live without causing harm - this includes yourself, other people, nature, the planet, etc.</li><li><strong>Satya:</strong> speak and live in truth.</li><li><strong>Asteya:</strong> don&rsquo;t take more that what you actually need.</li><li><strong>Brahmacharya:</strong> use your energy correctly, for the well-being of your Self and others.</li><li><strong>Aparigraha:</strong> don&rsquo;t be greedy or attached to things.</li></ul><p>Gardening more than anything else in life has illuminated the essence of Aparigraha for me. Anyone new to gardening is immediately interested in the harvest. From planning the many summer dishes they&rsquo;ll try, to counting canning jars, all before the seeds have sprouted. I love enthusiasm and sometimes the delight of potential is a catalyst for enthusiasm. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that. The problem becomes that when gardening gets tough, as it always does, that delight is like a shooting star - blazes hot and disappears quick. That delight and enthusiasm suddenly fades and the intention to garden evaporates along with it.</p><p>With yoga (all eight-limbs!) we learn to sit with things. It gives us the opportunity to redefine what it means to exist, which at its essence is to simply be present and feel all the feels as they come. Some of my favorite moments in the garden are simple. When I think back on the season, I often remember these things - not the harvest or the meal, but what I felt&mldr;</p><ul><li>Sowing seeds; the temperature of the earth on my fingertips as I create space for the seed to come home to.</li><li>The scent of all the different plants as I walk between beds, seducing me closer. The electromagnetic field of my heart crossing into plant territory and mixing together for a divine experience that cannot be mimicked, explained, or reasoned about.</li><li>Observing the life that arrives when you bring life into a space on earth. Plant the things and the insects will come. Each of them adding to the energy of the plant, the soil, the ether around it all. Most days I&rsquo;d see the same insects again and again. They, just as much as the plants, became familiar faces.</li><li>The sheer delight in the sight of edibles. It&rsquo;s the tiny cucumbers, green tomatoes, squash blooms that excite me the most. By the time I pick anything to eat I&rsquo;m simply swollen with gratitude, humbled, and honored at what it means to be nourished by all of this that I set in motion.</li></ul><p>The best way to understand something, truly, is to live it. It is easy enough to write the rules on a notecard and stick it to your refrigerator, but it is not until you <em>feel</em> it that you no longer think about the meaning, you live it.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t think Patanjali was gardening when he wrote about Aparigraha (though I like to think he was), but perhaps he felt the same essence deep in his bones then that I do now. That once Aparigraha is simply felt, it is woven into the fabric of your Self and you are forever awed by each moment, no longer chasing the bumper crop.</p></div><div class="mbsm border-left--ltgreen order1 order2--desktop flex__grow--desktop flex__basis flex__grow--desktop"><img src=/blog/2020-10-13_aparigraha/aparigraha-0_hud79d2e95c31e3bfcded1c667e052a393_766523_800x0_resize_q75_box.JPG srcset="/blog/2020-10-13_aparigraha/aparigraha-0_hud79d2e95c31e3bfcded1c667e052a393_766523_600x0_resize_q75_box.JPG 600w, /blog/2020-10-13_aparigraha/aparigraha-0_hud79d2e95c31e3bfcded1c667e052a393_766523_1000x0_resize_q75_box.JPG 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 1024) 525px, calc(100vw - 60px)" alt=aparigraha-0.JPG class="max-width plxs plsm--desktop mbxs mbsm--desktop" loading=lazy>

At the time I thought it was quite a large Rosemary bush; little did I know. Now, just 8 months later it&rsquo;s probably four times the size that it was then. Under the energy of the full moon, I pruned some of the branches, creating a little structure and harvesting the clippings. I bound 4-5 branches in cotton string and hung them to dry in our laundry closet, where I left them for several weeks. Despite being rather small, the laundry closet has turned out to be the perfect place to dry herbs. This is also where I dry my chamomile and any seeds I&rsquo;m saving.</p><p>Once completely dried I combed through each branch by hand, breaking every leaf from the woody stem and sifting through any debris. With hands covered in the aromatic oils I was nearly lost in euphoria of the scent and the process. My quart of dried Rosemary is infused, not just with fresh flavor, but with love and wonder, and with all the wildness that crossed over each branch as it pushed upward toward the call of the moon.</p><p>This Rosemary will become tea and will likely make its way onto Rosemary Lemon Roasted Potatoes (just in time for the holiday season). If I&rsquo;m working toward Yang energy (during the follicular phase, or first half of my cycle) it seems to resonate the most in a tea blend. Combined with chamomile, blue lotus, and Raspberry leaf I find it quite magickal. And while I don&rsquo;t have any documentation to back up this theory, I do feel that Rosemary warms and energizes my blood.</p><p>An old English saying goes, “Where Rosemary flourishes, the Woman rules”, believing that Rosemary only really flourished under the watchful eye of a powerful woman. I quite like this idea.</p></div><div class="mbsm border-left--ltgreen order1 order2--desktop flex__grow--desktop flex__basis flex__grow--desktop"><img src=/blog/2020-09-12_rosemary/rosemary-2_huc49cbe98997ff847f324813ab3110324_223511_800x0_resize_q75_box.JPG srcset="/blog/2020-09-12_rosemary/rosemary-2_huc49cbe98997ff847f324813ab3110324_223511_600x0_resize_q75_box.JPG 600w, /blog/2020-09-12_rosemary/rosemary-2_huc49cbe98997ff847f324813ab3110324_223511_1000x0_resize_q75_box.JPG 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 1024) 525px, calc(100vw - 60px)" alt="quart jar of dried Rosemary" class="max-width plxs plsm--desktop mbxs mbsm--desktop" loading=lazy>

The transformation of a humble urban backyard into an oasis of natural activity is truly magical. Life begets life. Insects are a part of this network, some we deem to have pest-like qualities and others beneficial. Regardless, they all serve a purpose in the balance of life. I, the gardener, must advocate for the plants when the success leans closer to pests and further from harvest. At the same time, I must recognize the purpose behind each of these beings and intervene only as needed. It&rsquo;s a motherly endeavor, this growing of plants. This video is a brief glance at some of these wonders of the garden - specifically those that challenge my harvesting efforts.</p></div></div><div><video width=1280 height=720 controls preload=none poster=/blog/2020-09-09_pest-tour/cover.jpg>

That&rsquo;s hard to find in a store. A bounty of basil is a joy in the garden and in the kitchen. This pesto is very easy to make and can be frozen for quick and delicious meals in the depths of winter, when the basil plants are long gone. It is lovely on breakfast sandwiches as we discovered with our friends in Raleigh. We also made a big pot of pasta with sauteed veg, fresh parmesan and pesto - one of my favorite ways to enjoy it.</p><p>To freeze, put into a freezer-safe container and drizzle more olive oil over the top to prevent freezer burn.
