The transformation of a humble urban backyard into an oasis of natural activity is truly magical. Life begets life. Insects are a part of this network, some we deem to have pest-like qualities and others beneficial. Regardless, they all serve a purpose in the balance of life. I, the gardener, must advocate for the plants when the success leans closer to pests and further from harvest. At the same time, I must recognize the purpose behind each of these beings and intervene only as needed. It&rsquo;s a motherly endeavor, this growing of plants. This video is a brief glance at some of these wonders of the garden - specifically those that challenge my harvesting efforts.</p></div></div><div><video width=1280 height=720 controls preload=none poster=/blog/2020-09-09_pest-tour/cover.jpg>

This pesto is very easy to make and can be frozen for quick and delicious meals in the depths of winter, when the basil plants are long gone. It is lovely on breakfast sandwiches as we discovered with our friends in Raleigh. We also made a big pot of pasta with sauteed veg, fresh parmesan and pesto - one of my favorite ways to enjoy it.</p><p>To freeze, put into a freezer-safe container and drizzle more olive oil over the top to prevent freezer burn.

Two years ago as my husband and I were planning for our early June, outdoor wedding I remember getting to the end of May after nearly 30 days straight rainshowers and wondering if I&rsquo;d made a mistake not planning for anything but the perfect sunny day. As luck would have it, our wedding was the first day in more than a month the rain passed over. We said our vows out in the pasture, under the most welcome sun rays I can ever remember.</p><p>This May has brought a similar amount of clouds and precipitation, but with flood-level downpours included. After nearly 4 days of nearly non-stop pouring rains, flooding of local rivers and creeks, and some crazy winds it has finally slowed down. We&rsquo;ve even gotten the occasional cloud break letting the sun have a go at pouring some rays.</p><p>Our garden beds held up swimmingly (ha, ha!) with no ponding, washouts, or other issues you might expect from record rainfall. A testament to the work we put into the soil. It both managed drainage and kept our plants nourished despite the near endless days of cloud cover. But with every triumph awaits a challenge and this time it&rsquo;s been slugs. Prior to all of this I noticed the wild birds would forage through the garden beds throughout the day, eating bugs and probaby slugs. Even in weeks of more sane levels of moisture I hadn&rsquo;t noticed an enormous amount of pest activity. Bring on the floodlevel rains and the birds tend to stay up in the trees more. The slugs had a true hay day in our greens bed. Near decimating our beautiful chard, very young spinach, and lettuces. Each leaf torn through like it was the last supper. One by one I picked them off. We elected to use an organic slug bait as well because I just didn&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d have a fighting chance otherwise. It&rsquo;s acute care, really, with the hope that as the weather resettles the birds can manage the few slugs that come on after this onslaught.</p><p>As I write, we&rsquo;re about a week out from that madness. The slug activity has slowed as I&rsquo;d imagined it would. Clouds loom today, with a few welcome breaks of sun. My basil starters have taken off so I added those to the beds this morning in place of the bolting radish that&rsquo;s clearly over this wack weather. As I picked through each of the beds I noticed flea beetles on the eggplant starters. I&rsquo;m trying out an all-natural DIY spray mixture recommended by Farmers Almanac and will write about the outcome as it unfolds. Hoping I&rsquo;ve caught it quick enough that they don&rsquo;t become a big problem. I&rsquo;ve got a few more basil coming in that I&rsquo;ll probably plant parallel to the eggplant in the hopes that it prevents the flea beetles from spreading too far. As I&rsquo;ve said before, always a dance this gardening business. Sometimes it&rsquo;s elegant and other times it&rsquo;s more like running barefoot across hot coals.</p></div><div class="mbsm border-left--ltgreen order1 order2--desktop flex__grow--desktop flex__basis flex__grow--desktop"><img src=/blog/2020-05-29_biblical-rains/biblical-rains-1_hu930a58753510ba9e2f559b8057926581_210177_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg srcset="/blog/2020-05-29_biblical-rains/biblical-rains-1_hu930a58753510ba9e2f559b8057926581_210177_500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 500w, /blog/2020-05-29_biblical-rains/biblical-rains-1_hu930a58753510ba9e2f559b8057926581_210177_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 800w, /blog/2020-05-29_biblical-rains/biblical-rains-1_hu930a58753510ba9e2f559b8057926581_210177_1000x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 1100px) 1100px, 100vw" alt="Closeup of slugs on lettuce" class="max-width plxs plsm--desktop mbxs mbsm--desktop" loading=lazy>

I&rsquo;m still learning the rhythms of nature here. Still discovering the beings that also call this little space home. Every morning Isaac and I (or Matt) head down to the back yard, so he can take care of his puppy dog business. We see all kinds of creatures - squirrels, rabbits (lots of babies right now!), crows and various song birds. In the evenings I like to sip an herbal tonic on the back deck and watch the sun lower just west McAfee. That&rsquo;s when I see bats, an occasional racoon, and hear the robins giggle just as the light fades into darkness.</p><p>One morning when we first moved here we spooked three does snoozing down in the ivy. Something I didn&rsquo;t expect to find in our little urban space. Back at the farmhouse we were used to the herd of 15 that had a routine daily traveling pattern. We were used to watching fawns nurse in tall spring grass and call for mom when she&rsquo;d been away too long.</p><p>Those are the magical moments I love, that I dreaded missing when we moved into town. It is nature&rsquo;s rhythms that ground me, make me feel whole and a part of a bigger story beyond my own. Where I find alignment and my truest source of self.</p><p>Changing spaces on earth did not fade this for me. It made me realize that my awareness is engaged in nature, that no matter where I am, I am whole.</p><p>As Isaac and I were out one recent morning, I sat at the edge of a garden bed to pick through weeds while he collected olfactory data. From my periphery I noticed something down at the end of the yard in the ivy moving around. Larger than a rabbit, but quieter than a cat or dog. We both sat, still as stones in the morning light, waiting to see what would emerge. To our delight, a pair of twin fawns just hours old and still wobbling appeared at the edge of our yard.</p><p>For days they stayed in the safety of the pines and ivy - secluded from the noise of urban existence. As Matt and I were working in the garden, the fawns began to bleet for mom. Just moments later she tore down into the yard, ears perked and eyes searching. We snuck quietly back inside, letting her nurture in solitude.</p><p>The following morning as I was out on the deck for my morning meditation. The doe appeared quietly, slowly making her way around a few shrubs. With a bob of her head a fawn appeared and began nursing. The fawn&rsquo;s legs spread wide, stablizing her tiny body. Her little tail flicking with seeming joy as she nursed her belly full. The doe licking and nuzzling her the entire meal. When she finished nursing, the doe walked back to the edge of the fence and waited for the fawn to bed down. The doe jumped the fence and waited once more for the fawn to bed down. She&rsquo;d take a step, and look back. Not leaving until her little babe was safe and settled.</p><p>These twin fawns arrived just as the moon was shifting new and settling into Gemini. As I pulled the lovers card, ruled by Gemini. I lay in bed and listen to them take turns calling for mom; these two, all legs and lungs. My cells vibrating with instincts. I&rsquo;ve been meditating a lot on what it means to exist as a female. On creative energy. On our innate nature to nurture. On love. All of this, manifesting into this moment.</p></div><div class="mbsm border-left--ltgreen order1 order2--desktop flex__grow--desktop flex__basis flex__grow--desktop"><img src=/blog/2020-05-20_gemini-twins/gemini-fawns-1_hu1e3d6086fbbcd70ea0997f864952d2d5_221769_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg srcset="/blog/2020-05-20_gemini-twins/gemini-fawns-1_hu1e3d6086fbbcd70ea0997f864952d2d5_221769_500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 500w, /blog/2020-05-20_gemini-twins/gemini-fawns-1_hu1e3d6086fbbcd70ea0997f864952d2d5_221769_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 800w, /blog/2020-05-20_gemini-twins/gemini-fawns-1_hu1e3d6086fbbcd70ea0997f864952d2d5_221769_1000x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 1100px) 1100px, 100vw" alt="fawn and doe behind trees" class="max-width plxs plsm--desktop mbxs mbsm--desktop" loading=lazy>

I am a force.</p><p>Day 21 and I&rsquo;m filled to the brim with Shakti. Divine feminine, creative power consumes me. Who am I now; creator.</p><p>I sip blood-hued tonics and delight in the endless layers of beauty around me. I am drunk on my own light. Euphoric.</p><p>Planting seeds and pulling weeds, singing ancient poetry all the while. The crows answering a divine call from pine perches. Guardians of my garden. This is alignment.</p><p>Day 28 we&rsquo;re filled and glowing and our power moves all the water. Svadhishthana. Pulling cup cards from the tarot day after day after day.</p><p>Day 29 I&rsquo;m hungover from the trip. Now waning. Settling. I&rsquo;m soft and calm. Turning inward.</p><p>I feel reborn and pure. Joyful and knowing. Living to the rhythm of the next phase. Cultivating the beginnings of creation once more.</p></div><div class="mbsm border-left--ltgreen order1 order2--desktop flex__grow--desktop flex__basis flex__grow--desktop"><img src=/blog/2020-05-10_i-shakti/i-shakti_hu8e400dda451769bfe90fbe57a0617bf7_227070_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg srcset="/blog/2020-05-10_i-shakti/i-shakti_hu8e400dda451769bfe90fbe57a0617bf7_227070_500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 500w, /blog/2020-05-10_i-shakti/i-shakti_hu8e400dda451769bfe90fbe57a0617bf7_227070_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 800w, /blog/2020-05-10_i-shakti/i-shakti_hu8e400dda451769bfe90fbe57a0617bf7_227070_1000x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 1100px) 1100px, 100vw" alt="woman doing balance pose in river" class="max-width plxs plsm--desktop mbxs mbsm--desktop" loading=lazy></div></div></div></div><div class=pageBoundary><div class="loader content tc mtxs mbxs phxs dn">Loading...</div><noscript><div class="content content--grid grid--gapsm--desktop phxs"><div class="df flex--row grid__12col grid__9col--desktop grid__3start--desktop"><span class=flex__grow></span><a class=button href=/page/2/>Next &rarr;</a></div></div></noscript></div></main></body></html>
