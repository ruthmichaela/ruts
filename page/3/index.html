There is a rhythm to the process: curating the perfect soil blend, dipping a finger into the soil, dropping the seed, covering, watering, warming, lighting, watching, and adjusting; witnessing and experiencing. Meditation in motion, driven by my [bhavana], or intention.</p><p>What is the soil and how does it work? What am I seeing and feeling and smelling? Is it dead or full of life? How will it feed the seeds? What feeds it? The sun and the microbiology and the fungi and the worms and the earth decay and the air and water. I see now; I see.</p><p>Seeds are a gift; what do they need? Don&rsquo;t read the packet; feel. Dig deeper. Observe the shape and color and texture in your hands. What does the plant want? Find stillness and listen. Mother the seeds.</p><p>What am I? The catalyst that ignites the process; dropping seed to soil. But more. What ignites the spark that drives the seed out of stillness? The light in my finger tips. Am I glowing? Have I nurtured my glow so that everything I touch illuminates? Is that possible? Of course, because I have witnessed it.</p><p>I cannot be nourished on words alone; while appetizing, they do not sustain me.</p><p>Just like the seeds, there is an innate wisdom programmed into each of my cells. The experience of my great great grandmothers and grandfathers moving through the same rhythm like a hymn that sings me. I know how to do this; they knew how to do this.</p><p>I find great comfort here. I&rsquo;m rooted and stable. Content. What I add to this knowing, through learning, is just play.
[bhavana] I wrote this post and then came across this lovely excerpt on the the interpretation of the word bhavana:</p><p><em>&ldquo;I imagine that when Gotama, the Buddha, chose this word to talk about meditation, he had in mind the ubiquitous farms and fields of his native India. Unlike our words &lsquo;meditation&rsquo; or &lsquo;contemplation,&rsquo; Gotama’s term is musty, rich, and verdant. It smells of the earth. The commonness of his chosen term suggests naturalness, everydayness, ordinariness. The term also suggests hope: no matter how fallow it has become, or damaged it may be, a field can always be cultivated — endlessly enhanced, enriched, developed — to produce a favorable and nourishing harvest&rdquo;</em></p><p><em>Quote Source: Glenn Wallis, Bhavana: A Guide to Classical Buddhist Meditation, 2009, draft copy, p. 7.

I&rsquo;d never heard of starting lavender from seed. Obviously people do it, but I&rsquo;d always understood it most easily propagated through cuttings. A few years ago, back at our rented farmhouse, I did cuttings from an existing lavender plant. The cuttings worked, but didn&rsquo;t really thrive. I didn&rsquo;t understand what conditions the lavender wanted. I just assumed because it had been planted in a particular place before my arrival that the research was done to ensure an adequate spot. I hadn&rsquo;t yet developed an eye for plant health or an understanding of variety requirements to know any better. Had I not witnessed this failing of the cuttings I wouldn&rsquo;t have questioned the situation or learned anything really. I guess you could say that it is failure, not success, in projects that excites me. This is where true learning happens. The kind of learning that sticks in your cells and limits the amount of failing that has to happen in order to succeed. Fail once, really, really brilliantly, and the path is cut.</p><p>So now here I am with a packet of seeds and some understanding of the conditions in which lavender thrives. It&rsquo;s a mediterranean herb that likes ample amounts of sunshine, semi-dry conditions, and rocky soil. I also know that starters have to have relatively coarse and airy soil to travel up out of the seed and into the light. I whipped up a combination of soils and made my own batch of starter soil, hoping it would nourish the seeds to their liking. This was a mix of soil from our raised beds, potting soil, and a bit of organic pre-packaged starter soil I had left over from last year.</p><p>As I&rsquo;d not started lavender from seed before I did a quick internet search for thoughts and advice, reading through my favorite university publications first and then through various blogs. For the most part I didn&rsquo;t find anything deeply profound. What was useful was reading about how lavender naturally propagates. If we can mimic nature as closely as possible, we are most likely to create the correct conditions for the plants. In the fall the lavender plant drops seed into the soil below the plant. These seeds then chill through winter and warm in the Spring. This transition to warmth is when germination occurs.</p><p>I collected an array of small pots (mostly made out of recyclables, like small paper boxes and toilet paper rolls) and filled them with my moistened soil mix. I then added a few seeds per container (with the intention of separating them if this experiment succeeded), wrapped and tied the tray of pots in a plastic bag, and placed it in the refrigerator. I took a guess at about 4 weeks of chill time, but later&mldr;perhaps out of excitement&mldr; settled for 26 days.</p><p>On March 6th I unwrapped the bag to find the soil still semi-moist and placed the pots on a heat pad. The pad increases the soil temperatures about ten degrees past the ambient temperature, which would have been about 78 degrees or so. Two days later we had emergence. A historically quick germination rate for me.</p><p>We are now at about 23 plants I believe, all of which are thriving quite nicely. I water them once a day with a simple misting bottle, carefully spraying the soil and avoiding drenching the delicate leaves. They get the same daily amount of sunlight as the tomatoes, about 12 hours a day at the time of writing this. They&rsquo;re mostly too small yet for hardening off, but I find introducing starters to outside conditions early makes for a hardier plant. I just stay mindful of the day and whether or not they&rsquo;re strong enough to handle the conditions. It has to be a gradual process. Too much too soon and the environmental overwhelm overloads the infant plant biology.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a delicate dance, this growing of plants. I adore the intuition and awareness it asks of me. It&rsquo;s an honor to get to do this; to mother the seeds into plants that will nourish the earth&rsquo;s soils and creatures.</p></div><div class="mbsm border-left--ltgreen order1 order2--desktop flex__grow--desktop flex__basis flex__grow--desktop"><img src=/blog/2020-04-18_starting-lavender/on-starting-lavender_hu08a5381291e9557b50e20bac56789038_190177_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg srcset="/blog/2020-04-18_starting-lavender/on-starting-lavender_hu08a5381291e9557b50e20bac56789038_190177_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 600w, /blog/2020-04-18_starting-lavender/on-starting-lavender_hu08a5381291e9557b50e20bac56789038_190177_1000x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 1000w"sizes="(min-width: 1024) 525px, calc(100vw - 60px)"alt="Small lavender plant starter"class="max-width plxs plsm--desktop mbxs mbsm--desktop"loading=lazy>
