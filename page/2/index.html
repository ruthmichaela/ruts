Two years ago as my husband and I were planning for our early June, outdoor wedding I remember getting to the end of May after nearly 30 days straight rainshowers and wondering if I&rsquo;d made a mistake not planning for anything but the perfect sunny day. As luck would have it, our wedding was the first day in more than a month the rain passed over. We said our vows out in the pasture, under the most welcome sun rays I can ever remember.</p><p>This May has brought a similar amount of clouds and precipitation, but with flood-level downpours included. After nearly 4 days of nearly non-stop pouring rains, flooding of local rivers and creeks, and some crazy winds it has finally slowed down. We&rsquo;ve even gotten the occasional cloud break letting the sun have a go at pouring some rays.</p><p>Our garden beds held up swimmingly (ha, ha!) with no ponding, washouts, or other issues you might expect from record rainfall. A testament to the work we put into the soil. It both managed drainage and kept our plants nourished despite the near endless days of cloud cover. But with every triumph awaits a challenge and this time it&rsquo;s been slugs. Prior to all of this I noticed the wild birds would forage through the garden beds throughout the day, eating bugs and probaby slugs. Even in weeks of more sane levels of moisture I hadn&rsquo;t noticed an enormous amount of pest activity. Bring on the floodlevel rains and the birds tend to stay up in the trees more. The slugs had a true hay day in our greens bed. Near decimating our beautiful chard, very young spinach, and lettuces. Each leaf torn through like it was the last supper. One by one I picked them off. We elected to use an organic slug bait as well because I just didn&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;d have a fighting chance otherwise. It&rsquo;s acute care, really, with the hope that as the weather resettles the birds can manage the few slugs that come on after this onslaught.</p><p>As I write, we&rsquo;re about a week out from that madness. The slug activity has slowed as I&rsquo;d imagined it would. Clouds loom today, with a few welcome breaks of sun. My basil starters have taken off so I added those to the beds this morning in place of the bolting radish that&rsquo;s clearly over this wack weather. As I picked through each of the beds I noticed flea beetles on the eggplant starters. I&rsquo;m trying out an all-natural DIY spray mixture recommended by Farmers Almanac and will write about the outcome as it unfolds. Hoping I&rsquo;ve caught it quick enough that they don&rsquo;t become a big problem. I&rsquo;ve got a few more basil coming in that I&rsquo;ll probably plant parallel to the eggplant in the hopes that it prevents the flea beetles from spreading too far. As I&rsquo;ve said before, always a dance this gardening business.

I&rsquo;m still learning the rhythms of nature here. Still discovering the beings that also call this little space home. Every morning Isaac and I (or Matt) head down to the back yard, so he can take care of his puppy dog business. We see all kinds of creatures - squirrels, rabbits (lots of babies right now!), crows and various song birds. In the evenings I like to sip an herbal tonic on the back deck and watch the sun lower just west McAfee. That&rsquo;s when I see bats, an occasional racoon, and hear the robins giggle just as the light fades into darkness.</p><p>One morning when we first moved here we spooked three does snoozing down in the ivy. Something I didn&rsquo;t expect to find in our little urban space. Back at the farmhouse we were used to the herd of 15 that had a routine daily traveling pattern. We were used to watching fawns nurse in tall spring grass and call for mom when she&rsquo;d been away too long.</p><p>Those are the magical moments I love, that I dreaded missing when we moved into town. It is nature&rsquo;s rhythms that ground me, make me feel whole and a part of a bigger story beyond my own. Where I find alignment and my truest source of self.</p><p>Changing spaces on earth did not fade this for me. It made me realize that my awareness is engaged in nature, that no matter where I am, I am whole.</p><p>As Isaac and I were out one recent morning, I sat at the edge of a garden bed to pick through weeds while he collected olfactory data. From my periphery I noticed something down at the end of the yard in the ivy moving around. Larger than a rabbit, but quieter than a cat or dog. We both sat, still as stones in the morning light, waiting to see what would emerge. To our delight, a pair of twin fawns just hours old and still wobbling appeared at the edge of our yard.</p><p>For days they stayed in the safety of the pines and ivy - secluded from the noise of urban existence. As Matt and I were working in the garden, the fawns began to bleet for mom. Just moments later she tore down into the yard, ears perked and eyes searching. We snuck quietly back inside, letting her nurture in solitude.</p><p>The following morning as I was out on the deck for my morning meditation. The doe appeared quietly, slowly making her way around a few shrubs. With a bob of her head a fawn appeared and began nursing. The fawn&rsquo;s legs spread wide, stablizing her tiny body. Her little tail flicking with seeming joy as she nursed her belly full. The doe licking and nuzzling her the entire meal. When she finished nursing, the doe walked back to the edge of the fence and waited for the fawn to bed down. The doe jumped the fence and waited once more for the fawn to bed down. She&rsquo;d take a step, and look back. Not leaving until her little babe was safe and settled.</p><p>These twin fawns arrived just as the moon was shifting new and settling into Gemini. As I pulled the lovers card, ruled by Gemini. I lay in bed and listen to them take turns calling for mom; these two, all legs and lungs. My cells vibrating with instincts. I&rsquo;ve been meditating a lot on what it means to exist as a female. On creative energy. On our innate nature to nurture. On love. All of this, manifesting into this moment.</p></div><div class="mbsm border-left--ltgreen order1 order2--desktop flex__grow--desktop flex__basis flex__grow--desktop"><img src=/blog/2020-05-20_gemini-twins/gemini-fawns-1_hu1e3d6086fbbcd70ea0997f864952d2d5_221769_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg srcset="/blog/2020-05-20_gemini-twins/gemini-fawns-1_hu1e3d6086fbbcd70ea0997f864952d2d5_221769_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 600w, /blog/2020-05-20_gemini-twins/gemini-fawns-1_hu1e3d6086fbbcd70ea0997f864952d2d5_221769_1000x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 1024) 525px, calc(100vw - 60px)" alt="fawn and doe behind trees" class="max-width plxs plsm--desktop mbxs mbsm--desktop" loading=lazy>

The sun was dipping low, flashing between the pines. I was working in one of the tomato beds. Removing volunteer grasses brought in by the straw, and pulling various weeds and things. Gently tugging and dropping. With the lift of heavier items the soil broke open, revealing the ecosystem of business it supports. Worms of all sizes whipping back into their dark home, tiny spiders scurrying to and fro, roly poly bugs crossing over the openings. Lost in observation, in the feeling of cold soil in my warm hands, of being. Running my hands across the tomatoes I started from seed, now rooting into the garden bed. The sweet smell of summer sticking to my skin, teasing my nose into telling my mouth to start planning for sun-soaked tomatoes. I did not hear the far-off noises, I didn&rsquo;t hear my mind thinking about anything I needed to do. I just was. I just am.</p><p>I am enough. My life is enough. Everything I have is enough. This is contentment.</p><p>I think in our modern society it&rsquo;s somewhat frowned upon to be content. Everybody hustlin' as the daft saying goes.</p><p>Contentment is symptom of gratitude. Sometimes it takes once not having to be thankful for what you now have. Sometimes it&rsquo;s simply a matter of taking stock of all that&rsquo;s around you. Of the people you adore in your life, of lessons you&rsquo;re learning, of being warm, fed, and with opportunity at your doorstep. Of things that bring you joy.</p><p>Before we eat any meal we give gratitude for the food before us. We know the many facets of effort involved from seed to plate. Gardening instills a sense of gratitude for life that is hard to explain in any other way.</p></div></div></article><article class="grid__12col grid__9col--desktop grid__3start--desktop mbsm mbmd--desktop"><div class="grid__3start--desktop xs mbsm mbmd--desktop"><a class=hoverUnderline href=/blog/2020-04-22_cherry-bell/><time class="dib mbxs letterspace" datetime=2020-04-29>2020-04-29</time></a><h1 class="upper letterspace">Cherry Bell</h1><div class="mra border-bottom--pink border-width"></div></div><div class="dg df--desktop"><div class="markdown mbxs prsm--desktop order2 order1--desktop flex__basis flex__grow--desktop"><p>I love radishes. I love them as a snack, in salads, and roasted. This is our first year trying them out in the garden and I&rsquo;m both impressed and delighted. My only complaint is that I didn&rsquo;t plant enough of them the first succession.</p><p>They are juicy, sharp and sweet, with the perfect little crunch. We sowed ours as soon as we noticed daffodils breaking through winter&rsquo;s grip. They were a little slow to start, but are now cruising. I may have put them in a touch too early, but the excitement could not be contained.</p><p>We have 6 brand new raised beds this year and I come equipped with more knowledge than any season prior. This is the fun part of gardening, right? Growing with each season. My intention for this year is to promote and improve soil health and to experiment with companion planting. I&rsquo;m beyond the point of reading about it all and now into the realm of creativity and intuition. I&rsquo;m experimenting with mixing herbs and annuals in the beds alongside vegetables. I want to create a balanced system that makes the vegetable plants practically feel like they&rsquo;re at a five-star luxury resort, just soaking up the sun and relishing in the beauty of existence. With blooms sprinkled throughout, I aim to encourage pollinators to come flying in, rewarding the plants with pollination like it&rsquo;s a pina colada bar. (It&rsquo;s COVID quarantine, and i&rsquo;m still dreaming of our cancelled beach vacation)</p><p>Once you begin to notice the bright red radish popping up through the soil you know it will be ready for picking soon. Look for a good-sized diameter and healthy, strong greens.</p><p>As you can see in the photos, I&rsquo;m using straw mulch. Just prior to getting it down (ya know, waiting on the wind to chill for a second) we had some radishes split. I suspect this was from the naked soil getting slightly dry, followed by a heavy drenching rain. The little radish swelled and burst. It still tasted amazing, but I needn&rsquo;t the delicate things cracking on me. With mulch on, I&rsquo;ve not seen it occur again. I&rsquo;m partial to straw mulch at the moment, and it&rsquo;s serving the soil well. It&rsquo;s holding moisture longer (duh, not evaporating) and the soil temps are staying more even despite a few suprise frost-advisory evenings. The soil also looks gorgeous after a few weeks cozied up in the mulch. I didn&rsquo;t line the soil first, so I am getting some grass growth. However, it&rsquo;s easy enough to grab hold of, pull, and drop back into the soil (it&rsquo;s also strangely fun and satisfying). Free organic matter, IMO. Last year I did burlap and liked it well enough. This year I just didn&rsquo;t even think about it. We&rsquo;ll see if I pay for it come late season.</p><p>Radish is a good balancer of Yin and Yang (warm and cool/light and dark) energies. With Spring comes Kapha (&lsquo;that which flourishes in water&rsquo;, translated from Sanskrit) qualities of warmth, heavy, earthy, and transformational. Radish is perfect for us during this time, as we begin transitioning our bodies out of winter mode. If you&rsquo;re still feeling winter&rsquo;s chill in your bones, you can roast radishes in a bit of oil (I like avocado) with salt and pepper. This is one of my very favorite ways to enjoy them. If you&rsquo;re still feeling winter&rsquo;s cold chill, you may want to avoid cold and raw, as your body won&rsquo;t have the heat and energy to effeciently digest it just yet.</p><p>I would encourage anyone starting out to give radishes a go. They are so delicious (even little Issac tried to sneak away with a bite&mldr;) and give a good boost of encouragement when winter lingers on.</p></div><div class="mbsm border-left--ltgreen order1 order2--desktop flex__grow--desktop flex__basis flex__grow--desktop"><img src=/blog/2020-04-22_cherry-bell/radish-1_huecfd8b466324d032643464be80b09a4f_177520_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg srcset="/blog/2020-04-22_cherry-bell/radish-1_huecfd8b466324d032643464be80b09a4f_177520_600x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 600w, /blog/2020-04-22_cherry-bell/radish-1_huecfd8b466324d032643464be80b09a4f_177520_1000x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 1024) 525px, calc(100vw - 60px)" alt="dog sniffing radish" class="max-width plxs plsm--desktop mbxs mbsm--desktop" loading=lazy>
