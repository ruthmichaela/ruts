The sun was dipping low, flashing between the pines. I was working in one of the tomato beds. Removing volunteer grasses brought in by the straw, and pulling various weeds and things. Gently tugging and dropping. With the lift of heavier items the soil broke open, revealing the ecosystem of business it supports. Worms of all sizes whipping back into their dark home, tiny spiders scurrying to and fro, roly poly bugs crossing over the openings. Lost in observation, in the feeling of cold soil in my warm hands, of being. Running my hands across the tomatoes I started from seed, now rooting into the garden bed. The sweet smell of summer sticking to my skin, teasing my nose into telling my mouth to start planning for sun-soaked tomatoes. I did not hear the far-off noises, I didn&rsquo;t hear my mind thinking about anything I needed to do. I just was. I just am.</p><p>I am enough. My life is enough. Everything I have is enough. This is contentment.</p><p>I think in our modern society it&rsquo;s somewhat frowned upon to be content. Everybody hustlin&rsquo; as the daft saying goes.</p><p>Contentment is symptom of gratitude. Sometimes it takes once not having to be thankful for what you now have. Sometimes it&rsquo;s simply a matter of taking stock of all that&rsquo;s around you. Of the people you adore in your life, of lessons you&rsquo;re learning, of being warm, fed, and with opportunity at your doorstep. Of things that bring you joy.</p><p>Before we eat any meal we give gratitude for the food before us. We know the many facets of effort involved from seed to plate. Gardening instills a sense of gratitude for life that is hard to explain in any other way.</p></div></div></div><div class="grid__12col grid__9col--desktop grid__3start--desktop mbsm mbmd--desktop"><div class="grid__3start--desktop xs mbsm mbmd--desktop"><a class=hoverUnderline href=/blog/2020-04-22_cherry-bell/><time class="dib mbxs letterspace" datetime=2020-04-29>2020-04-29</time></a><h1 class="upper letterspace">Cherry Bell</h1><div class="mra border-bottom--pink border-width"></div></div><div class="dg df--desktop"><div class="markdown mbxs prsm--desktop order2 order1--desktop flex__basis flex__grow--desktop"><p>I love radishes. I love them as a snack, in salads, and roasted. This is our first year trying them out in the garden and I&rsquo;m both impressed and delighted. My only complaint is that I didn&rsquo;t plant enough of them the first succession.</p><p>They are juicy, sharp and sweet, with the perfect little crunch. We sowed ours as soon as we noticed daffodils breaking through winter&rsquo;s grip. They were a little slow to start, but are now cruising. I may have put them in a touch too early, but the excitement could not be contained.</p><p>We have 6 brand new raised beds this year and I come equipped with more knowledge than any season prior. This is the fun part of gardening, right? Growing with each season. My intention for this year is to promote and improve soil health and to experiment with companion planting. I&rsquo;m beyond the point of reading about it all and now into the realm of creativity and intuition. I&rsquo;m experimenting with mixing herbs and annuals in the beds alongside vegetables. I want to create a balanced system that makes the vegetable plants practically feel like they&rsquo;re at a five-star luxury resort, just soaking up the sun and relishing in the beauty of existence. With blooms sprinkled throughout, I aim to encourage pollinators to come flying in, rewarding the plants with pollination like it&rsquo;s a pina colada bar. (It&rsquo;s COVID quarantine, and i&rsquo;m still dreaming of our cancelled beach vacation)</p><p>Once you begin to notice the bright red radish popping up through the soil you know it will be ready for picking soon. Look for a good-sized diameter and healthy, strong greens.</p><p>As you can see in the photos, I&rsquo;m using straw mulch. Just prior to getting it down (ya know, waiting on the wind to chill for a second) we had some radishes split. I suspect this was from the naked soil getting slightly dry, followed by a heavy drenching rain. The little radish swelled and burst. It still tasted amazing, but I needn&rsquo;t the delicate things cracking on me. With mulch on, I&rsquo;ve not seen it occur again. I&rsquo;m partial to straw mulch at the moment, and it&rsquo;s serving the soil well. It&rsquo;s holding moisture longer (duh, not evaporating) and the soil temps are staying more even despite a few suprise frost-advisory evenings. The soil also looks gorgeous after a few weeks cozied up in the mulch. I didn&rsquo;t line the soil first, so I am getting some grass growth. However, it&rsquo;s easy enough to grab hold of, pull, and drop back into the soil (it&rsquo;s also strangely fun and satisfying). Free organic matter, IMO. Last year I did burlap and liked it well enough. This year I just didn&rsquo;t even think about it. We&rsquo;ll see if I pay for it come late season.</p><p>Radish is a good balancer of Yin and Yang (warm and cool/light and dark) energies. With Spring comes Kapha (&lsquo;that which flourishes in water&rsquo;, translated from Sanskrit) qualities of warmth, heavy, earthy, and transformational. Radish is perfect for us during this time, as we begin transitioning our bodies out of winter mode. If you&rsquo;re still feeling winter&rsquo;s chill in your bones, you can roast radishes in a bit of oil (I like avocado) with salt and pepper. This is one of my very favorite ways to enjoy them. If you&rsquo;re still feeling winter&rsquo;s cold chill, you may want to avoid cold and raw, as your body won&rsquo;t have the heat and energy to effeciently digest it just yet.</p><p>I would encourage anyone starting out to give radishes a go. They are so delicious (even little Issac tried to sneak away with a bite&mldr;) and give a good boost of encouragement when winter lingers on.</p></div><div class="mbsm border-left--ltgreen order1 order2--desktop flex__grow--desktop flex__basis flex__grow--desktop"><img src=/blog/2020-04-22_cherry-bell/radish-1_huecfd8b466324d032643464be80b09a4f_177520_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg srcset="/blog/2020-04-22_cherry-bell/radish-1_huecfd8b466324d032643464be80b09a4f_177520_500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 500w, /blog/2020-04-22_cherry-bell/radish-1_huecfd8b466324d032643464be80b09a4f_177520_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 800w, /blog/2020-04-22_cherry-bell/radish-1_huecfd8b466324d032643464be80b09a4f_177520_1000x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 1100px) 1100px, 100vw" alt="dog sniffing radish" class="max-width plxs plsm--desktop mbxs mbsm--desktop" loading=lazy>

It took me a few days to debate over the perfect timing; too soon and the cold will stunt the growth; too late and the high heat of summer will challenge the fruit.</p><p>Under warm but cloudy skies I dug small holes into the raised beds. The soil has been covered in straw, awaiting their arrival. For each scoop of soil I lifted out, 2 or 3 lively earth worms were there, wriggling in the light. I&rsquo;m sure they weren&rsquo;t thrilled to be unearthed, if even briefly. Can&rsquo;t say I blame them. It looks right lovely in there. Deep color, lots of aggregates, moist, and smelling of sweet, rich earth. The most lovely soil I&rsquo;ve ever had the privilege of dipping my hands into.</p><p>The tomatoes are a mix of three different varities: black brandywine, black cherry, and yellow pear, all of which I started from seed. The black cherry were seeds I saved from last year. We bought the plant from a local greenhouse in Buchanan, VA and really loved the flavor. The black brandywine are a heirloom variety that we&rsquo;ve grown before. The fruits are big and beautifully purple with a really lovely, balanced flavor.</p><p>The yellow pear are another favorite of ours, low in acid, sweet, and delicious raw or sauteed. Our Ameraucana hen absolutely loved finding these. She&rsquo;d fling one around with her beak until the flesh tore open, revealing the juicy seeds. Then she&rsquo;d gobble the whole thing down; all the while giving a warning cluck for the other hens to forget about even attempting to take it.</p><p>This is my third true season growing our own plants. Because of the timing of our move, I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d be able to pull off starters this year. However, our budget is small and I had all of the seeds and soil on hand. I had to at least give it a try. As if by fate, this has been my most successful starter year to date. As with most things, learning requires time (to attempt and observe the outcome, if nothing else), and persistence. All of my transplants so far (tomatoes and cabbage) have not shown a single sign of transplant shock. In seasons past I really struggled with shock - not only with my plants, but also purchased plants. Primarily I witnessed wilt, which they&rsquo;d eventually recover from, but the stress involved on the plant always felt like an unnecessary setback.</p><p>What I observed this year in the plants prior to transplanting:</p><ul><li>A steady rate of growth</li><li>Strong central stems (early on when I separated the tomatoes from one shallow pot into larger single pots I buried the stems up to about a 1/4&rdquo; from the leaves. This allowed for deeper root growth. All the fuzzy hairs on a tomato stem are capable of becoming new root systems).</li><li>1 or 2 of the tomato plants experienced a little bit of sunburn on the leaves. At one point I had them covered in a box with plexi to block heavy winds. I think the direct sun hit a couple of them through the plexi and caused this.</li><li>Vibrant roots. Releasing the plants from the pots, just before moving them to the ground, I found the roots to be plentiful, thick, and very bright white. The roots appeared to have a soft, fuzziness to them, all branching deep and downward with some wrapping around the perimeter of the pot&rsquo;s walls.</li></ul><p>As I placed each plant into their designated areas of the garden, I felt a strange sense of letting them go. I&rsquo;d grown quite accustomed to our daily routine together: check, water, move from indoors to out, water, protect from too high of winds, and monitor growth from seed to strong plant. My energy mixing with theirs, readying them&mldr;and perhaps me, too&mldr; for this moment.</p><p>With each plant tucked into their new places, I pulled the straw up to the plants, like a well-worn quilt, and gave each a good soak of water. They look beautiful nested in the raised beds. Our routine together is different now. On to phase II you might say. And here in the coming months, all this energy and care I&rsquo;ve put into these plants will find its way back to us as we&rsquo;re nourished in the thank you&rsquo;s reaching out of blossoms.</p></div><div class="mbsm border-left--ltgreen order1 order2--desktop flex__grow--desktop flex__basis flex__grow--desktop"><img src=/blog/2020-04-29_tomatoes-are-in/tomatoes-are-in_hu0422a3fb31e21fa167d96d6812c4c2c8_194904_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg srcset="/blog/2020-04-29_tomatoes-are-in/tomatoes-are-in_hu0422a3fb31e21fa167d96d6812c4c2c8_194904_500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 500w, /blog/2020-04-29_tomatoes-are-in/tomatoes-are-in_hu0422a3fb31e21fa167d96d6812c4c2c8_194904_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 800w, /blog/2020-04-29_tomatoes-are-in/tomatoes-are-in_hu0422a3fb31e21fa167d96d6812c4c2c8_194904_1000x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 1100px) 1100px, 100vw" alt="Small tomatoes in starter pots" class="max-width plxs plsm--desktop mbxs mbsm--desktop" loading=lazy></div></div></div><div class="pxs psm--desktop border--ltgreen grid__12col grid__9col--desktop grid__3start--desktop mbsm mbmd--desktop"><div class=tc><a class="hoverUnderline tc dib mbxs mla mra" href=/blog/2020-04-25_morning-reflections/><time class=letterspace datetime=2020-04-25>2020-04-25</time></a></div><h1 class="tc upper letterspace">Morning Reflections</h1><div class="mbsm mra mla border-bottom--pink border-width"></div><div class="markdown mbxs mbmd--desktop"><p>The thoughts swirl and then settle, like a snow globe shaken for a season and then set aside.</p><p>Soften the face, the eyes, the lips, and tongue.

Pulling the straw off, lifting grass and henbit out and sorting through what&rsquo;s what. Seeds shift in the wind and rain, moving out of the perfect line you hope to create. Or perhaps the earth worms and Armadillidiidae have some kind of game they play called, &ldquo;rearrange the seeds, as to confuse the lady.&rdquo;</p><p>This season we&rsquo;re growing rainbow chard, buttercrunch lettuce, and bloomsdale spinach as our greens of choice. By the looks of what I thinned today, we&rsquo;ll have far more than a family of 2.5 (2 humans + 1 shelter puppy turned mama&rsquo;s boy, whose meals I make) can possibly eat. A surplus for friends and family. The greens are only a few inches tall, but I&rsquo;m already salivating. They look so beautiful and delicious. Colorful and crisp. With everything reorganized I think we&rsquo;re in the ballpark of 30 or so plants. It felt so nice getting all the plants put into order and tucked back into their straw cover. We&rsquo;ve also got a big long row of chamomile coming in, another first for us. I drink only two things: water and herbal tea. I am excited to add to my homegrown herbal tea selection and hopefully have extra to make gifts with.
Lettuce in garden bed</p><p>It&rsquo;s always a bit tricky starting something new from direct sow. When small, the spinach looks pretty darn similar to a tiny plantain weed. There&rsquo;s really not a handbook (that I know of, anyway) for vegetable sprout identification, so I&rsquo;m navigating it intuitively and hoping to get it right.</p><p>Cabbage starters also went in today, along with some direct sow bush beans directly behind them. It&rsquo;s still a bit cool yet for the tomato starters to go in, so I&rsquo;m holding out a couple more weeks for those.</p><p>Despite some unexpected frosty evenings, drenching rains, and super high winds, the plants are doing beautifully. This is the earliest I&rsquo;ve ever had things rolling in the garden and it&rsquo;s exciting. We&rsquo;re barely into the season and I&rsquo;ve already learned a plethora of new things. Because we started totally raw this year, and on our own property, we&rsquo;ve been able to take our time in setting things up exactly how we want. The raised beds are filled with a garden mix (top soil, cow manure, sawdust, and leaf compost) from a local landscape store and tilled into the existing soil. While I&rsquo;m currently keen on no-till management, my options were limited for getting started with the given timeline. Moving forward we intend to go totally no-till, implementing cover crops in the off-season, and ally planting with rotation.</p><p>I spent the last two months participating in Cornell University&rsquo;s Small Farms online program, completing both the soil health and beekeeping courses. Both left me profoundly inspired and educated with so many new concepts (like cover cropping) to bring to our mono-family urban farm.

There is a rhythm to the process: curating the perfect soil blend, dipping a finger into the soil, dropping the seed, covering, watering, warming, lighting, watching, and adjusting; witnessing and experiencing. Meditation in motion, driven by my [bhavana], or intention.</p><p>What is the soil and how does it work? What am I seeing and feeling and smelling? Is it dead or full of life? How will it feed the seeds? What feeds it? The sun and the microbiology and the fungi and the worms and the earth decay and the air and water. I see now; I see.</p><p>Seeds are a gift; what do they need? Don&rsquo;t read the packet; feel. Dig deeper. Observe the shape and color and texture in your hands. What does the plant want? Find stillness and listen. Mother the seeds.</p><p>What am I? The catalyst that ignites the process; dropping seed to soil. But more. What ignites the spark that drives the seed out of stillness? The light in my finger tips. Am I glowing? Have I nurtured my glow so that everything I touch illuminates? Is that possible? Of course, because I have witnessed it.</p><p>I cannot be nourished on words alone; while appetizing, they do not sustain me.</p><p>Just like the seeds, there is an innate wisdom programmed into each of my cells. The experience of my great great grandmothers and grandfathers moving through the same rhythm like a hymn that sings me. I know how to do this; they knew how to do this.</p><p>I find great comfort here. I&rsquo;m rooted and stable. Content. What I add to this knowing, through learning, is just play.
[bhavana] I wrote this post and then came across this lovely excerpt on the the interpretation of the word bhavana:</p><p><em>&ldquo;I imagine that when Gotama, the Buddha, chose this word to talk about meditation, he had in mind the ubiquitous farms and fields of his native India. Unlike our words &lsquo;meditation&rsquo; or &lsquo;contemplation,&rsquo; Gotama’s term is musty, rich, and verdant. It smells of the earth. The commonness of his chosen term suggests naturalness, everydayness, ordinariness. The term also suggests hope: no matter how fallow it has become, or damaged it may be, a field can always be cultivated — endlessly enhanced, enriched, developed — to produce a favorable and nourishing harvest&rdquo;</em></p><p><em>Quote Source: Glenn Wallis, Bhavana: A Guide to Classical Buddhist Meditation, 2009, draft copy, p. 7.

I&rsquo;d never heard of starting lavender from seed. Obviously people do it, but I&rsquo;d always understood it most easily propagated through cuttings. A few years ago, back at our rented farmhouse, I did cuttings from an existing lavender plant. The cuttings worked, but didn&rsquo;t really thrive. I didn&rsquo;t understand what conditions the lavender wanted. I just assumed because it had been planted in a particular place before my arrival that the research was done to ensure an adequate spot. I hadn&rsquo;t yet developed an eye for plant health or an understanding of variety requirements to know any better. Had I not witnessed this failing of the cuttings I wouldn&rsquo;t have questioned the situation or learned anything really. I guess you could say that it is failure, not success, in projects that excites me. This is where true learning happens. The kind of learning that sticks in your cells and limits the amount of failing that has to happen in order to succeed. Fail once, really, really brilliantly, and the path is cut.</p><p>So now here I am with a packet of seeds and some understanding of the conditions in which lavender thrives. It&rsquo;s a mediterranean herb that likes ample amounts of sunshine, semi-dry conditions, and rocky soil. I also know that starters have to have relatively coarse and airy soil to travel up out of the seed and into the light. I whipped up a combination of soils and made my own batch of starter soil, hoping it would nourish the seeds to their liking. This was a mix of soil from our raised beds, potting soil, and a bit of organic pre-packaged starter soil I had left over from last year.</p><p>As I&rsquo;d not started lavender from seed before I did a quick internet search for thoughts and advice, reading through my favorite university publications first and then through various blogs. For the most part I didn&rsquo;t find anything deeply profound. What was useful was reading about how lavender naturally propagates. If we can mimic nature as closely as possible, we are most likely to create the correct conditions for the plants. In the fall the lavender plant drops seed into the soil below the plant. These seeds then chill through winter and warm in the Spring. This transition to warmth is when germination occurs.</p><p>I collected an array of small pots (mostly made out of recyclables, like small paper boxes and toilet paper rolls) and filled them with my moistened soil mix. I then added a few seeds per container (with the intention of separating them if this experiment succeeded), wrapped and tied the tray of pots in a plastic bag, and placed it in the refrigerator. I took a guess at about 4 weeks of chill time, but later&mldr;perhaps out of excitement&mldr; settled for 26 days.</p><p>On March 6th I unwrapped the bag to find the soil still semi-moist and placed the pots on a heat pad. The pad increases the soil temperatures about ten degrees past the ambient temperature, which would have been about 78 degrees or so. Two days later we had emergence. A historically quick germination rate for me.</p><p>We are now at about 23 plants I believe, all of which are thriving quite nicely. I water them once a day with a simple misting bottle, carefully spraying the soil and avoiding drenching the delicate leaves. They get the same daily amount of sunlight as the tomatoes, about 12 hours a day at the time of writing this. They&rsquo;re mostly too small yet for hardening off, but I find introducing starters to outside conditions early makes for a hardier plant. I just stay mindful of the day and whether or not they&rsquo;re strong enough to handle the conditions. It has to be a gradual process. Too much too soon and the environmental overwhelm overloads the infant plant biology.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a delicate dance, this growing of plants. I adore the intuition and awareness it asks of me. It&rsquo;s an honor to get to do this; to mother the seeds into plants that will nourish the earth&rsquo;s soils and creatures.</p></div><div class="mbsm border-left--ltgreen order1 order2--desktop flex__grow--desktop flex__basis flex__grow--desktop"><img src=/blog/2020-04-18_starting-lavender/on-starting-lavender_hu08a5381291e9557b50e20bac56789038_190177_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg srcset="/blog/2020-04-18_starting-lavender/on-starting-lavender_hu08a5381291e9557b50e20bac56789038_190177_500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 500w, /blog/2020-04-18_starting-lavender/on-starting-lavender_hu08a5381291e9557b50e20bac56789038_190177_800x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 800w, /blog/2020-04-18_starting-lavender/on-starting-lavender_hu08a5381291e9557b50e20bac56789038_190177_1000x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 1100px) 1100px, 100vw" alt="Small lavender plant starter" class="max-width plxs plsm--desktop mbxs mbsm--desktop" loading=lazy>
